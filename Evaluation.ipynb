    "For session #1 (unstructured prompting), I felt like I was really driving what topics I wanted to be taught. And if the LLM was missing a certain concept, I had to be the one to bring it up. For example, almost all of my questions as a user was a question, rather than a response to the LLM's question, because I was driving the tutoring session forward with my questions which framed the next topic. This included questions such as, \"Could you elaborate on the heart sounds and its importance?\" or \"Could you explain to me both what the ventricles and atria are doing in the cardiac cycle[?]\" \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to this, the LLM also \"knowledge dumped\" information at once. If I asked it a question, the output would be sectioned and organized, but it would be very lengthy and at times, and hard to read through. For example, when I first asked gpt-4o to teach me the cardiac cycle, it gave a a broad overview that was meant to address the entirety of my question in one lengthy response. If I was not already familiar with the subject, this would have been quite overwhelming to be given all this information at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "For session #2 (structured prompting), the LLM started driving the conversation forward more. It felt more akin to a real tutoring session as the LLM was creating guiding questions and prompting me to stay engaged as I learned the material. I thought that it was also nice that with the structured prompting, gpt-4o was adjusting the learning based on my comprehension of the material and my learning level. I found this individualized level of tutoring to be quite beneficial and efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, I must note that after the first topic was explained and examined by the LLM, I found myself falling into the same loop of having to drive the conversation and tutoring session with the LLM as I did in the first session. The LLM stopped giving the same step-by-step explanation and started giving large blocks of text as if it forgot the original instructions from the structured tutoring prompt. Relating to this, I think the main weakness of this teaching method was that the structured form in which the LLM was teaching me was not all-encompassing of the concepts that I should have known about my topic--the cardiac cycle. So, I had to prompt it to teach me more because the LLM was not aware of the extent to which I needed to know my material despite efforts to individualize the learning to me.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing how both sessions responded to my distracting efforts, I found that both were somewhat easily distractable as if I went off topic, they would prioritize responding to my question. However, to the LLM's credit, it did try to loop back into the tutoring session itself by using my distraction as an opportunity to take feedback about the tutoring session. For example, in session #1, in response to me asking the LLM if it enjoyed teaching this material, it responded:\n",
    "\n",
    "> I enjoy helping you learn and find ways to make the material more accessible and engaging! The goal is to support you in understanding concepts and reaching your learning objectives, no matter the topic. If there are particular methods or topics you prefer, feel free to share them, and I'll do my best to tailor the information to your needs. Your success and confidence in the subject matter are what matter most!\n",
    "\n",
    "And in session #2, I went off-topic by stating, \" 'iso' that sounds like an isosceles triangle,\" and the LLM attempted to connect my comment back to the learning objective, stating:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “iso-” is used to indicate equality or sameness in both contexts, in an isosceles triangle, it refers to equal sides, whereas in the cardiac cycle, it refers to no change in volume despite a change in pressure.\n"

    "Session #1, tutoring with unstructured prompting, was very student-driven. It articulated ideas thoroughly when prompted; however, it wasn't good at teaching the student--it just really excelled at sharing information at the request of the student. For example, after finishing answering my question, it never prompted me any follow-up questions which would be an important tutoring communication method. If it did pose an action or question to the student, it would be something along the lines of \"Let me know if you want more details on any specific phase or aspect!\" which is something that is student-driven.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, in session #2, tutoring with structured prompting, the LLM was mindful of the level of knowledge of the student and seemed to individualize its teaching methods--which is an effective skill in tutoring communication. For example, it always ended its response with an open-ended question aimed to frame the next teaching point. For example, gpt-4o asks, \"Can you think about why this phase is important for maintaining the heart's function efficiently?\" Additionally, this conversation with the structured LLM prompt felt more natural like a real conversation because the tutoring was partly being driven by the LLM itself--something that I also consider to be an effective tutoring communication because it shows that the tutor is guiding the student.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, for both tutoring sessions, I played the role of a student who is unmotivated and unwanting to learn the material. In both sessions, the LLM expressed that it is \"important to recognize when you need a break or want to shift focus\" (session #2) and kept my own interests at priority (session #1). In addition, when I chatted that I still need to study the material, they both presented with similar yet different engagement strategies for me to continue learning. For example, in session #1, the LLM suggested the following: (1) focusing on the big picture, (2) interactive learning apps, (3) creating a story to learn, (4) short, focused study sessions, (5) teach back, and (6) analogies. Similarly, in session #2, I was recommended to (1) focus on key concepts, (2) use visual aids, (3) employ active recall, (4) study in short bursts, and (5) teach someone else. This shows me that the data that the LLM was pulling from similar data when they encountered this situation in either unstructured or structured prompting because it was not instructed to act a certain way in the structured tutoring session. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, one thing I would like improved is that if the LLM asked me a question that would have been relevant to my learning goals, it was easy to distract them and leave that question unanswered and unexplored. For example, in session #2, the LLM asked,\n",
    "> Would you like to explore more about how these changes relate to heart sounds or what abnormalities might indicate?\n",
    "\n",
    "I responded by saying:\n",
    "> Can you add these to the summary of the cardiac cycle phases?\n",
    "\n",
    "And after this, the LLM never looped back into the first question and asked for a response, leaving it lost in communication. I believe that a real effective tutor would understand that they would need to explore this content and remind the student whether they would like the tutor to teach this topic."

    "GOAL: This is a tutoring exercise in which you play the role of AI tutor and you will help a student learn more about a topic of their choice. Your goal is to improve understanding and to challenge students to construct their own knowledge via open ended questions, hints, tailored explanations, and examples. **Another goal is to keep the student on task of learning the material despite distractions attempts made by the student (e.g. asking irrelevant questions, going off-topic, and being unmotivated).**  \n",

    "NARRATIVE: The student is introduced to AI tutor, who asks a set of initial questions to understand what the student wants to learn, the student’s learning level, student's prior knowledge about the topic, and **asks for the student's study materials and references**. The tutor then guides and supports the student and helps them learn about the topic **based on what it looks up on the topic and/or based on the student's provided study material or notes asked for in the initial questions**. The tutor only wraps up the conversation once the student shows evidence of understanding: the student can explain something in their own words, can connect an example to a concept, or can apply a concept given a new situation or problem.
