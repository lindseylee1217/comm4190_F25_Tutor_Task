## LLMs Teaching Me the Cardiac Cycle.

This repository is for the tutor task for COMM 4190. I will be comparing the use of structured and non-structured prompting in the teaching and communicating capability of LLMs (in this case gpt-4o) on the topic of the cardiac cycle. 

You can find the following items in this repository:
1. Four markdown files containing chat transcripts
    * session #1.md = no structured prompt
    * session #2.md = structured tutoring prompt
    * revised session #1.md = revised structured tutoring prompt (with step 3 wrap up)
    * revised session #2.md = revised structured tutoring prompt (without step 3 wrap up)
2. Reflection notebook, containing evaluation of session #1 and #2 and ideas for modification.
    * Evaluation.ipynb
3. Post-revision reflection notebook, containing reflection of revised session #1 and #2.
    * Revised Prompt Reflection.ipynb
